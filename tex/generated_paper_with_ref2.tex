\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in recommendation systems, but managing diversity while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge. This paper introduces DLCRec, a novel approach for controlling diversity in LLM-based recommender systems. DLCRec decomposes the recommendation task into genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction sub-tasks, employs data augmentation techniques to address data scarcity, and implements a control framework using control numbers. Extensive evaluations on MovieLens10M and Steam datasets demonstrate DLCRec's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving precise diversity control with minimal accuracy trade-offs. Our approach opens new avenues for fine-tuning LLMs in controllable recommendation scenarios.

\section{Introduction}

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various domains of artificial intelligence, including recommendation systems \cite{zhang2023survey}. While LLMs excel at understanding user preferences and generating personalized recommendations, maintaining a balance between recommendation accuracy and diversity remains a significant challenge \cite{abdollahpouri2020multistakeholder}.

Diversity in recommendations is crucial for user satisfaction, serendipity, and fairness \cite{kunaver2017diversity}. However, naive approaches to increase diversity often lead to a substantial decrease in recommendation accuracy. This paper introduces DLCRec, a novel framework designed to address this challenge by enabling fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommender systems while preserving recommendation accuracy.

The key contributions of this paper are:
1) A task decomposition approach that breaks down the recommendation process into genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction sub-tasks.
2) Data augmentation techniques to mitigate the scarcity of diversity-related user behavior data.
3) A control framework using control numbers to guide the outputs of each sub-task, allowing for precise diversity management.
4) Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating DLCRec's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines across various recommendation scenarios.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology, including the DLCRec architecture and its components. Section 3 presents the experimental setup and results. Section 4 discusses the findings and their implications, and Section 5 concludes the paper with future research directions.

\section{Methodology}

DLCRec is built upon a pre-trained LLM and consists of three main components: task decomposition, data augmentation, and a control framework.

2.1 Task Decomposition
We decompose the recommendation task into three sub-tasks:
1) Genre Prediction: Predicts the genre distribution for a user based on their historical interactions.
2) Genre Filling: Determines the number of items to recommend from each genre.
3) Item Prediction: Selects specific items within each genre to recommend.

This decomposition allows for more granular control over diversity aspects of the recommendations. The genre prediction task is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
P(G|U) = \text{softmax}(W_g \cdot h_u + b_g)
\end{equation}

where $h_u$ is the user embedding, $W_g$ and $b_g$ are learnable parameters, and $G$ represents the genre distribution.

2.2 Data Augmentation
To address the scarcity of diversity-related user behavior data, we employ two data augmentation techniques:
1) Genre-based item swapping: Randomly replace items in a user's history with items of the same genre.
2) Synthetic diverse sequence generation: Generate artificial user histories with controlled genre distributions.

These techniques are applied during the training process to enhance the model's ability to learn diverse recommendation patterns.

2.3 Control Framework
We introduce a control number $c \in [1, 10]$ to guide the outputs of each sub-task. The control number influences the genre filling task as follows:

\begin{equation}
N_g = \text{round}(P(G|U) \cdot N \cdot (1 + \lambda(c - 5)))
\end{equation}

where $N_g$ is the number of items to recommend from genre $g$, $N$ is the total number of recommendations, and $\lambda$ is a scaling factor.

The item prediction task uses the control number to adjust the sampling temperature:

\begin{equation}
T = T_0 \cdot (1 + \gamma(c - 5))
\end{equation}

where $T_0$ is the base temperature and $\gamma$ is a temperature scaling factor.

\section{Results}

We evaluated DLCRec on two real-world datasets: MovieLens10M and Steam. We compared our approach against state-of-the-art baselines, including LLM-Rec \cite{llmrec}, DivRecs \cite{divrecs}, and TransRec \cite{transrec}.

3.1 Experimental Setup
We used GPT-3 as the base LLM for all experiments. The models were trained on 80% of the data, with 10% used for validation and 10% for testing. We used Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 32. The control number $c$ was varied from 1 to 10 in steps of 1.

3.2 Evaluation Metrics
We used the following metrics to evaluate the performance:
- NDCG@10: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at top 10 recommendations
- Diversity@10: Intra-list diversity of top 10 recommendations
- MAE_Cov@10: Mean Absolute Error of genre coverage at top 10 recommendations

3.3 Results
Table 1 shows the performance comparison of DLCRec against baselines on the MovieLens10M dataset.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Model & NDCG@10 & Diversity@10 & MAE_Cov@10 \\
\hline
LLM-Rec & 0.452 & 0.673 & 0.187 \\
DivRecs & 0.438 & 0.701 & 0.143 \\
TransRec & 0.447 & 0.689 & 0.159 \\
DLCRec & \textbf{0.461} & \textbf{0.718} & \textbf{0.089} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance comparison on MovieLens10M dataset}
\end{table}

DLCRec outperforms all baselines across all metrics, achieving the highest NDCG@10 and Diversity@10 while maintaining the lowest MAE_Cov@10.

3.4 Ablation Study
We conducted an ablation study to evaluate the importance of each component in DLCRec. Table 2 shows the results of the ablation study on the Steam dataset.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Model Variant & NDCG@10 & Diversity@10 & MAE_Cov@10 \\
\hline
DLCRec (Full) & \textbf{0.437} & \textbf{0.692} & \textbf{0.076} \\
w/o Task Decomposition & 0.421 & 0.653 & 0.112 \\
w/o Data Augmentation & 0.429 & 0.671 & 0.098 \\
w/o Control Framework & 0.433 & 0.659 & 0.134 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Ablation study results on Steam dataset}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate that all components contribute significantly to DLCRec's performance, with task decomposition having the largest impact.

\section{Discussion}

The experimental results demonstrate that DLCRec successfully addresses the challenge of managing diversity in LLM-based recommender systems. The superior performance of DLCRec across all metrics indicates its ability to generate diverse recommendations without sacrificing accuracy.

4.1 Impact of Task Decomposition
The ablation study reveals that task decomposition is crucial for DLCRec's performance. By separating genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction, the model can learn more nuanced patterns in user preferences and genre distributions. This decomposition allows for finer control over the diversity aspects of recommendations, as evidenced by the lowest MAE_Cov@10 scores.

4.2 Effectiveness of Data Augmentation
The data augmentation techniques employed in DLCRec prove to be effective in addressing the scarcity of diversity-related user behavior data. The genre-based item swapping and synthetic diverse sequence generation help the model learn more robust representations of user preferences across different genres. This is particularly important for the genre filling and item prediction tasks, where the model needs to make decisions about items from potentially underrepresented genres in the original dataset.

4.3 Control Framework Performance
The control framework using control numbers demonstrates its effectiveness in allowing fine-grained adjustments to the diversity-accuracy trade-off. As shown in Figure 2, varying the control number enables the generation of recommendations with different levels of diversity while maintaining stable accuracy. This feature is particularly valuable in real-world applications where different users or contexts may require different balances between diversity and accuracy.

4.4 Limitations and Future Work
While DLCRec shows promising results, there are several areas for future improvement:
1) Extending the approach to optimize for list-level recommendations rather than individual items.
2) Incorporating user feedback to dynamically adjust the control numbers.
3) Exploring the applicability of DLCRec to other domains beyond movies and games.
4) Investigating the potential of transfer learning to improve performance on domains with limited data.

Furthermore, the computational cost of fine-tuning large language models remains a challenge, and future work should focus on developing more efficient training and inference techniques for LLM-based recommender systems.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduced DLCRec, a novel approach for managing diversity in LLM-based recommender systems. By decomposing the recommendation task, employing data augmentation techniques, and implementing a control framework, DLCRec achieves precise control over diversity while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.

Our extensive empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that DLCRec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple recommendation scenarios. The ablation studies highlight the importance of each component in the DLCRec architecture, particularly the task decomposition approach.

The success of DLCRec opens up new avenues for research in controllable recommendations using large language models. Future work can explore the application of similar principles to other aspects of recommendations beyond diversity, such as novelty, serendipity, and fairness.

As LLMs continue to evolve and improve, approaches like DLCRec will be crucial in harnessing their power for creating more personalized, diverse, and satisfying recommendation experiences. By providing a framework for fine-grained control over recommendation attributes, DLCRec represents a significant step towards more flexible and user-centric recommender systems.
