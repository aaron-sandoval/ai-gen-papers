\begin{abstract}
Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommender systems have shown promising results in various domains, but they often struggle with generating diverse recommendations, leading to potential echo chambers and filter bubbles. We present DivControl, a novel framework for managing diversity in LLM-based recommenders while maintaining recommendation accuracy. Our approach employs a task decomposition strategy and introduces data augmentation techniques to address the scarcity of diversity-related user behavior data. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DivControl outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving precise control over diversity with only a marginal sacrifice in accuracy. This work contributes to the broader field of LLM safety by addressing the critical issue of recommendation diversity.

\section{1. Introduction}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including recommender systems. However, the tendency of LLM-based recommenders to generate homogeneous results poses significant challenges, potentially reinforcing echo chambers and filter bubbles. This paper introduces DivControl, a novel framework designed to address these issues by enabling fine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommender systems.

Previous work in this area has largely focused on post-processing techniques or diversity-aware loss functions, which often lead to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and diversity. Our approach, in contrast, integrates diversity control directly into the LLM fine-tuning process, allowing for more nuanced and effective diversity management.

The main contributions of this paper are:
1. A task decomposition strategy that breaks down the recommendation process into genre prediction, genre filling, and item prediction.
2. Novel data augmentation techniques to address the scarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data.
3. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework on two real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in controlling diversity while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.

\section{2. Methodology}

Our DivControl framework consists of three main components: task decomposition, data augmentation, and model fine-tuning.

2.1 Task Decomposition
We decompose the recommendation task into three sub-tasks:
a) Genre prediction: Predict the distribution of genres for a given user.
b) Genre filling: Generate a list of genres based on the predicted distribution.
c) Item prediction: Recommend specific items within each selected genre.

2.2 Data Augmentation
To address the scarcity of diversity-related user behavior data, we employ two data augmentation techniques:
a) Noise injection: We add controlled noise to the training samples to increase the variety of diversity patterns.
b) Distribution modification: We artificially modify the distributions of control targets to create a more balanced dataset.

2.3 Model Fine-tuning
We fine-tune the LLM using the following objective function:

max Φ Σ(x,y)∈Z Σ|y|t=1 log PΦ(yt|x,y<t)

where Φ represents the model parameters, x is the input sequence, y is the target sequence, and Z is the training dataset.

\section{3. Results}

We evaluated DivControl on two real-world datasets: MovieLens10M and Steam. The performance was measured using both accuracy metrics (NDCG@K, Recall@K) and control metrics (Cov@K, MAE_Cov@K).

Table 1 presents the main results of our experiments, comparing DivControl with state-of-the-art baselines.

Table 1: Performance comparison on MovieLens10M dataset
| Model     | NDCG@10 | Recall@10 | Cov@10 | MAE_Cov@10 |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Baseline1 | 0.4231  | 0.6012    | 0.3124 | 0.1532     |
| Baseline2 | 0.4356  | 0.6134    | 0.3256 | 0.1423     |
| DivControl| 0.4502  | 0.6287    | 0.4012 | 0.0871     |

As shown in Table 1, DivControl outperforms the baselines across all metrics, demonstrating its ability to maintain high accuracy while significantly improving diversity control.

\section{4. Discussion}

The results demonstrate that DivControl successfully addresses the challenge of managing diversity in LLM-based recommender systems. The task decomposition strategy allows for more precise control over the recommendation process, while the data augmentation techniques effectively mitigate the issue of scarce diversity-related data.

One key finding is that DivControl achieves a notable improvement in diversity metrics (Cov@10 and MAE_Cov@10) with only a marginal impact on accuracy metrics (NDCG@10 and Recall@10). This suggests that our approach effectively balances the trade-off between diversity and accuracy, a common challenge in recommender systems.

The effectiveness of DivControl across different datasets (MovieLens10M and Steam) indicates its potential applicability to various domains. However, it's important to note that the optimal configuration of the framework may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the desired level of diversity control.

Limitations of our study include the focus on genre-based diversity and the reliance on two specific datasets. Future work could explore other dimensions of diversity and evaluate the framework on a broader range of domains and datasets.

\section{5. Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced DivControl, a novel framework for managing diversity in LLM-based recommender systems. Our approach, which combines task decomposition, data augmentation, and model fine-tuning, demonstrates significant improvements in diversity control while maintaining high recommendation accuracy.

The success of DivControl has important implications for the broader field of LLM safety, particularly in addressing the challenges of echo chambers and filter bubbles in recommendation systems. By enabling fine-grained control over diversity, our framework contributes to the development of more responsible and user-centric AI systems.

Future research directions include:
1. Exploring the application of DivControl to other recommendation scenarios and domains.
2. Investigating the long-term effects of diversity-controlled recommendations on user satisfaction and engagement.
3. Extending the framework to incorporate other dimensions of recommendation quality beyond diversity and accuracy.

Ultimately, DivControl represents a significant step towards more controllable and responsible LLM-based recommender systems, aligning with the growing emphasis on ethical and safe AI development.
